Hello,

My name is Temi Michael, but I like to call myself Lazy Coder.

So I named this calculator after me because it is a simple logic calculator with the basic functions put into various components.
The addition, Subtraction, Division, Multiplication, Input Reset, Result Reset, and General Reset buttons.
Before I forget, I named it "The Lazy Calculator".

Happy Coding.
